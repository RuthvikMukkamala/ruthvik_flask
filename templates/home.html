        Hi, my name is Ruthvik Mukkamala.
        <br><br>
        I like quantitative research for financial markets, machine learning, and computer vision. I am current student
          at New York University studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
        <br><br>
        I manage my own fund, Roebling Research, where I have consistently outperformed hedge fund competitors. I started the fund on January 3rd, 2023 - my 2024 YTD performance is 12%.
        <br><br>
        My fund is focused on fundamental equity trading. I am a disciple of Warren Buffett and Bill Ackman - I believe in investing in great companies at fair prices. The engineer in me wants to learn the market which is why I have added systematic equity trading.
        <br><br>
        I have also previously worked as a developer for the Macro Quant Development Team at Balyasny Asset Management in 2023. I also worked on HIFI, a music-tech startup acquired by Block, Inc in 2022 as a software engineering intern. I loved the focus of a lean team passionate about building financial services for a targeted audience.
        <br><br>
        My page serves my opinions and mine alone. I will share research papers, essays, and books I have read or written.
